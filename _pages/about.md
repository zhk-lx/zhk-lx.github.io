I am Huikai Zhang, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute of Biomechanics and Medical Engineering, Department of Engineering Mechanics, Tsinghua University. My research interests include biomechanics, biophysics, computational mechanics, and structural optimization theory. My recent ongoing work focuses on optimization design of multicellular life (e.g., organoids) and digital organs.  

I have been awarded the “China Postdoctoral Innovation Talent Support Program”, the “Shuimu Postdoctoral Fellowship” at Tsinghua University, and the “Qinghang Scholar” title at Tsinghua University.   

My academic profile can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=l_1Pj34AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and my advisor is Professor Xi-Qiao Feng, whose profile is also available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hpg2NCcAAAAJ&hl=en).
