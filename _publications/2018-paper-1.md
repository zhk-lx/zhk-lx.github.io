This paper presents a new bi-material microstructural design method for chiral auxetic metamaterials. Based on the independent point-wise density interpolation (iPDI) and a bi-material model, optimal design problem of periodic unit cells is formulated using nodal density variables. The design objective is to minimize the Poissonâ€™s ratio while satisfying the specified volume constraints of the hard and soft materials, and the effective elastic properties of the bi-material microstructure are computed by the asymptotic homogenization method under periodic boundary conditions. This topology optimization problem is solved with a gradient-based mathematical programming algorithm on the basis of the sensitivity analysis. Several numerical examples, regarding design of anisotropic, orthogonal anisotropic and isotropic bi-material microstructures of chiral auxetic metamaterials, are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. It is shown that the proposed bi-material design optimization method can be used to improve the performance of chiral auxetic metamaterials through enlarging the design space.
