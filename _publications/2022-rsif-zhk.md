The growth and development of biological tissues and organs strongly depend on the requirements of their multiple functions. Plant veins yield efficient nutrient transport and withstand various external loads. Victoria cruziana, a tropical species of the Nymphaeaceae family of water lilies, has evolved a network of three-dimensional and rugged veins, which yields a
superior load-bearing capacity. However, it remains elusive how biological and mechanical factors affect their unique vein layout. In this paper, we propose a multi-functional and large-scale topology optimization method to investigate the morphomechanics of Victoria cruziana veins, which optimizes both the structural stiffness and nutrient transport efficiency. Our results suggest that increasing the branching order of radial veins improves the efficiency of nutrient delivery, and the gradient variation of circumferential vein sizes significantly contributes to the stiffness of the leaf. In the present method, we also consider the optimization of the wall thickness and the maximum layout distance of circumferential veins. Furthermore, biomimetic leaves are fabricated by using the three-dimensional printing technique to verify our theoretical findings. This work not only gains insights into the morphomechanics of Victoria cruziana veins, but also helps the design of, for example, rib-reinforced shells, slabs and dome skeletons.
