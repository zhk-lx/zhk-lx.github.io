Precise control of the jumping direction and trajectory of soft robotics poses a challenge due to their large deformation and low stiffness. In this paper, we propose a pneumatic soft actuator consisting of an inward semi-spherical shell with a pre-existing T-shaped incision, which exhibits asymmetric snapping-through buckling under an increasing internal pressure. During the dynamic snapping, the shell deforms rapidly, resulting in an asymmetric, inclined impact with the ground. The impact force drives the soft actuator to jump in a controllable direction, and the adopted semi-open pneumatic system greatly improves the efficient utilization of air ejection energy. This design not only enhances the jumping performance, but also allows the control of the trajectory through adjusting the air pressure. Our experiments demonstrate that the actuator can achieve various jumping functions, for examples, to jump over obstacles of varying heights and depths, to execute rapid and continuous 
locomotion, and even to escape from a deep bottle. This work offers a paradigmatic idea for designing highly maneuverable and controllable soft robots.
